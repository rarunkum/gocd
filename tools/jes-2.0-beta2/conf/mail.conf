# Java Email Server Configuration File

# JES features a as-needed approach to activating its services.
# This applies to both the MTA and user mail retrieval aspect
# of its profile.

# Mail Transfer Mode. Options are: Full, Local, Remote (case
# insensitive)
# In full mode all incoming and outgoing SMTP messages will be
# served as expected.
# In local mode, mail is delivered only to local recipients. Any
# connecting client is accepted as a valid mail sender, provided
# no security issues arise.
# In remote mode, no messages for local recipients are accepted.
# Only authenticated users (that is users belonging to a domain
# serviced by a JES instance, who properly authenticate) are
# allowed as valid mail senders.
# Default: Full
#mail.transfer.mode=

# User Mail Retrieval Mode. Options are: POP3, None (case
# insensitive)
# Default: POP3
#mail.retrieval.mode=

# Define the directory where all incoming SMTP messages are
# to be stored. If not specified a default is used.
# Default: <JES dir in main class arguments>/smtp
#incoming.directory=

# Define the directory where the user accounts are to be
# located. If not specified a default is used.
# Default: <JES dir in main class arguments>/users
#users.directory=

# The configuration address is the local IP address (not a host name) that
# JES will listen for incoming configuration commands on.  If this value is
# not set, this ability will be disabled. Only internal network addresses
# allowed (that is the loopback and site local addresses).
# No default
#configuration.address=
# Default: 41001
#configuration.port=

# The listen address is the loopback or site local IP address (or host name)
# that JES will listen for incoming connections on. If this value is not set,
# it will listen on all addresses. Please see entry external.delegated in
# section Server Security Policy.
# Default: 0.0.0.0
#listen.address=

# The port number to listen for incoming SMTP connection on.
# This value should be set to 25 unless you really know what you are doing.
# Default: 25
#smtpport=

# The port number to listen for incoming POP3 connections on.
# This value should be set to 110 unless you really know what you are doing.
# Default: 110
#pop3port=

# Each service is configured to use a pool of threads to handle incoming
# connections.  This property defines the number of threads allocated to
# each pool.  The number of threads will be the total number of clients
# each non secure service (SMTP, POP3) can handle at one time.
# Default: 5
#threads=

# The server limits the size of incoming emails.  The default size is 5 MB.
# This settings is in MegaBytes (MB).
# Default: 5
#smtp.messagesize=

# The server stores incoming SMTP messages on disk before attempting to deliver them.  This
# setting determines how often (in seconds) the server checks the disk for new messages to deliver.  The
# smaller the number, the faster message will be processed.  However, a smaller number will cause
# the server to use more of your system's resources.
# Default: 10
#smtpdelivery.interval=

# The server picks the messages from the disk in order to deliver them.  If some message
# cannot be delivered to remote SMTP server at that moment, because of some error, then the message
# will be kept on the disk for later delivery attempt. However server can't retry delivery
# indefinitely, therefore following config entry will set maximum number of retries before the server
# gives up on the message and moves it from smtp spool directory to failed directory.
# Default: 10
#smtpdelivery.threshold=

# This property defines the domains that are considered 'local'. In order
# to receive email for local users, their domain must be defined here.
# multiple domains can be added as a comma seperated list.
# ex: domains=mydomain1.com,mydomain2.com
# No default
#domains=

# If an email is received for a mailbox at a local domain, but the mailbox does not exist,
# JES can deliver the email to a 'default' mailbox. To enable this feature, uncomment this
# property and set it to a valid mailbox. A default mailbox can be specified for any subset
# of domains. Seperate entries with a comma.
# No default
#defaultMailbox=

# It may be neccessary to configure your SMTP server to deliver all outgoing
# mail through a gateway SMTP server.  This may be the case if your ISP blocks outgoing
# SMTP connections.  This setting allows you to define a single SMTP server that your server
# will send all remote mail to.
# Optional: add ":PortNumber" after the SMTP server to specify the port number. ex : smtp.myisp.com:25
# Optional: add "/user:password" to specify a username and password to the default SMTP server.
# More than one server can be defined in a comma seperated list.
#defaultsmtpservers=smtp.myisp.com
#defaultsmtpservers=smtp.myisp.com:587/mailuser:mailpass

# The following properties configure the rules for relaying SMTP
# mail.  If an incoming email message matches any of the rules,
# it will be accepted for relay.  If none of the rules match, it
# will be rejected.  Be default, all rules are disabled.

# POP before SMTP enables users who check their POP3 account to
# relay mail for a given period of time.  When they authenticate
# with the POP3 server, their IP address is added to a 'allow relay'
# list for a given period of time.
# Default: false
#relay.popbeforesmtp=

# If POP before SMTP is enabled, this value defines the length of time in minutes
# that the authenticated IP address stays valid.
# Default: 10
#relay.popbeforesmtp.timeout=

# Individual IP addresses can be specified to allow email to be relayed.
# This can be useful if you want to provide access to specific machines or
# sets of machines, including your localhost.  Wildcards can be used
# to specify a range of addresses.
# ex: 192.168.*.* allows all addresses that start with 192.168 to
# relay email.  Partial wildcards are not allowed. ex: 19*.168.0.1 is invalid.
# Multiple addresses can be specified as a comma separated list.
relay.ipaddresses=127.0.0.1

# Individual 'from' email addresses can be specified to allow email
# sent from that address to be relayed.
# WARNING: Anyone who knows what email addresses are allowed to relay
# may send email from those addresses, including SPAMers.  This should
# be used with caution.
# Multiple email addresses can be specified as a comma separated list.
# Email addresses are case insensitive.
# You can specify a blank username (@domain) to allow a whole domain.
#relay.emailaddresses=me@mydomain.com,@myotherdomain.com

# Enable/disable the 8bitmime feature
# Default: true
#8bitmime.enable=

####################### Secure Connection Settings #######################
# Activation of secure SMTP/POP3 modules
# Default: false
#secureactive=

# The port number to listen for incoming Secure SMTP connection on.
# This value should be set to 465 unless you really know what you are doing.
# Default: 465
#securesmtpport=

# The port number to listen for incoming Secure POP3 connections on.
# This value should be set to 995 unless you really know what you are doing.
# Deafult: 995
#securepop3port=

# Each service is configured to use a pool of threads to handle incoming
# connections.  This property defines the number of threads allocated to
# each pool.  The number of threads will be the total number of clients
# each secure service (secure SMTP, secure POP3) can handle at one time.
# Default: 2
#securethreads=

# The usage scenarios for the trustore are
# a. Use the default truststore provided by the JVM. In this case leave all trustore
#    entries commented
# b. Use a custom defined truststore. Such a scenario materializes should the JVM can
#    not locate a default truststore or the JES admin wishes to use an alternate
#    trustore.
# At least trustore.location has to be set.
# JSSE default: jssecacerts, if it exists. Otherwise, cacerts
#truststore.location=

# Truststore provider. (optional, if truststore location not properly set it is ignored)
# Default: SUN
#truststore.provider=

# Trustore type. (optional, if truststore location not properly set it is ignored)
# Note that unlike keystore type this setting doesn't default to a particular
# truststore type. This is so that it doesn't interfere with the default JVM behaviour.

######################### Server Security Policy #########################
# Enable/Disable the Security Manager. A file named jes.policy must be placed
# in the jes install directory for the Security Manager to function properly.
# Note that the default implementation of the SUN Security Manager only allows
# localhost to be used as a listening address. JES bypasses the relative check
# and verifies the permissions in the ServiceListener instances right before
# instantiating the serverSockets.
# Default: false
#enable.SecurityManager=

# Enable/disable the HELO command during a receiver SMTP session.
# It is strongly recommended not to have this enabled. It will be set to
# disable if either the secure connections are activated, SSL/TLS is enabled on
# standard ports or DIGEST-MD5/GSS-API are enabled. Enabling HELO presents an
# extremely dangerous choice and effectively cancels any security context.
# Default: false
#enable.HELO=

# Notify default user of changes to user/mail.conf? This only affects the
# first domain in the local domains list.
# Default: false
#notify.default=

# Disable poping up a warning message when changes to user/mail.conf have been
# applied? Disabling requires that notify.default is set to true and that a
# default user has been defined. If set to true, no changes will be applied to
# a running instance.
# Default: false
#disable.warning=

# If the network's external IP has been delegated to the server/workstation/
# home computer running JES and JES is to use this IP to listen for incoming
# connections, set the following to true. Otherwise startup will fail.
# This setting is not dynamically updated.
# Default: false
#external.delegated=

# Define here the desired authentication for a connecting client (SMTP/POP3)
# in a TLS/SSL context. Allowed values are required, requested, no.
# Default: no
#client-auth=

# Use TLS/SSL for outgoing SMTP messages if the server being contacted supports
# the STARTTLS extension (RFC 3207)
# Default: false
#outgoingSecure=

# Use TLS/SSL on standard listening ports
# Default: false for both properties
#standardSMTPsecure=
#standardPOP3secure=

# Allow clear text passwords or not (Selections are always, encryptedOnly, never)
# encryptedOnly refers to a TLS/SSL encrypted connection
# This setting's value is of the form SMTP:<selection>,POP3:<selection> and is
# case-insensitive. Example: allowClearText=sMtP:NeVer,POP3:aLwAYS
# Default: encryptedOnly for both
#allowClearText=

# Should a nonexistent local recipient be rejected during a smtp server session
# or be accepted and either have the message be deliver to the postmaster or if
# one is not set have the message bounced to the mail sender?
# This situation is quite an interesting one. If rejection is selected then the
# server discloses information concerning the existence or not of a mailbox.
# On the other hand if such a recipient is accepted and no postmaster is set
# the mail gets bounced back, so the effect is the same as in the first case.
# The most prudent course is to accept all local users (whether in existence or
# not) AND have a postmaster set. But in this case the postmaster accepts the
# responsibility of alerting the mail sender in case such a mail is delivered
# to the postmaster's mailbox.
# Default:false (as was up to JES 1.6.1)
#reject.nonexistent.local=

# The maximum number of errors in a SMTP/POP3 session before the connection is
# forcibly shut down. Reverts to a default of 10 for values <10.
# Default: 10
#max.error.count=

# The maximum number of password attempts a connecting client is allowed
# to make before a permanent negative reply is sent (RFC 4954/9)
# This is also used in a pop3 session to close the connection should this
# threshold be crossed.
# Default: No restriction
# Minimum: 3
#max.pass.attempts=

# Maximum number of ACCEPTED RCPT commands.
# Any RCPT command exceeding this threshold will receive a 452 reply.
# Default: 100
# Minimum: 100 (RFC 5321/4.5.3.1.8)
#max.valid.rcpt=

# Added percentage to max.valid.rcpt.cmd that will result in a 503 reply
# to a DATA command.
# Default: 10
# Minimum: 5
#added.pct.rcpt=

# The policy for the two following settings is applied as such:
# If there is more than the minimum failed RCPT cmds AND the percentage of
# failed RCPT commands per total RCPT commands is greater than the minimum
# percentage then force a disconnection. This is in accordance with
# RFC 5321/3.8,7.8

# Minimum total of failed RCPT commands that will result in a forced
# disconnection.
# Default: 20
# Minimum: 20
#min.tot.fail.rcpt=

# Minimum percentage of failed RCPT commands that will result in a forced
# disconnection.
# Default: 90
# Minimum: 70
#min.pct.fail.rcpt=

# Use the dnswl/dnsbl facility
# Default: false
#verify.ip=

# Select the protection level the server will advertise during a SASL
# authentication negotiation. Options are any combination of auth,auth-int,
# auth-conf separated by commas.
# Default: all three options
#sasl.qop=

# Advertise the DIGEST-MD5 SASL authentication mechanism?
# Default: true
#sasl.digest-md5.enable=

# Select the ciphers to be used by a sasl digest-md5 confidentiality
# protected session. Available options are 3des,des,rc4,rc4-40,rc4-56.
# Default: 3des,rc4
#sasl.digest-md5.ciphers=

# Advertise the GSSAPI SASL authentication mechanism?
# Default: false
#sasl.GSS.enable=

# The realm(aka Domain in Windows) JES's smtp kerberos 5 service is a part of.
# Example: EXAMPLE.COM. Will be converted to upper case.
# No default
#sasl.GSS.realm=

# The realm's kerberos 5 kdc host name, e.g. krb.example.com
# No default
#sasl.GSS.kdc=

# Set the principal name to be used by JES to authenticate itself during
# a SASL JGSS negotiation. The typical form of a Kerberos 5 service principal
# is serviceType/hostname@REALM, e.g. smtp/mail.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM.
# Please note that per RFC 4752 'Use of server's principal names having
# GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE name type and "service@hostname" format...
# is RECOMMENDED'. However SUN's GSS SASL implementation requires that a
# SASLServer is acquired from the SASL factory by calling a static method
# where both protocol(serviceType) and server name are supplied. If one
# checks out the openJDK6 source's com.sun.security.sasl.gsskerbGssKrb5Server
# file it is obvious that the service/host format is mandatory when using
# SUN's implementation. The consequence of this is that
# non GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE identities can not be used. A dual smtp/pop 
# serviceType is assumed by JES and if no smtp/hostname and pop/hostname principal
# exists in the default kerberos realm authentication will fail. To conclude,
# the following formats are acceptable:
# 1. host.example.com: smtp and pop are assumed to be the service types.
# 2. SMTPServiceName:POP3ServiceName/host.example.com: ....serviceName(e.g. ldap)
# is used instead of smtp or pop. Possible combos for this case are:
# ldap:pop/host.example.com, (use ldap as smtp, pop as pop)
# :ldap/host.example.com, (use default as smtp, ldap as pop)
# pop:/host.example.com, (use pop as smtp, default as pop)
# ldap/host.example.com. (use ldap as both smtp & pop)
# A small courtesy to JES admins should a kerberos service principal already
# exist and it is not desired/acceptable to create a new principal. In both
# cases the realm is assumed to be the default realm supplied. The matching is
# done internally by sasl/kerberos, not JES.
# No default
#sasl.GSS.principal=

# A flag to indicate whether the principal's key is to be stored in the
# subject's private credentials.
# Default: true
#sasl.GSS.storeKey=

# A flag to indicate whether to attempt to acquire the principal's key from the
# keytab. If this fails, or the flag is set to false, a window will popup to
# request the password at startup.
# Default: false
#sasl.GSS.useKeyTab=

# The location of the keytab. Must be an absolute path,
# e.g. /home/username/krb5.keytab
# No default
