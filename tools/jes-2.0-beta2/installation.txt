******************* WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING *******************
Do not attempt to run JES simply by invoking the jar as an argument
for a java executable, unpleasant discomfort will be the only result.
Certain arguments have to be passed to the JVM and JES itself. See
sections "Java Service Wrapper","Running JES using mail.bat in Windows/
mail.sh in Unix-likes" in AdditionalNotes.txt for details regarding
these arguments and/or the mail.bat/mail.sh code.
******************* WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING *******************


***** Security Note *****
JES ships with the security manager off by default. You must change the relative entry
in section Server Security Policy of mail.conf to enable it. You are strongly encouraged
to read AdditionalNotes.txt, particularly the "Security policy entries that need manual
editing" section.


To install and run this mail server, carry out the following:

Install a Java JDK or JRE version 1.5 or greater (http://java.sun.com or http://www.java.com).

Install the JCE (Jave Cryptography Extension). Read the AdditionalNotes.txt's "Java Cryptographic
Key Strength Policy" section for details.

* Windows Installation *

1. Expand the distribution archive.

2. Modify the included script files for your local file system (if necessary).

3. Edit the mail.conf, user.conf, log4j.properties(optionally), wrapper.conf files as needed.
   See section entitled "Setting up JES for the first time" in AdditionalNotes.txt.

4. Supply (if needed) the necessary passwords in the "password" file in the security
   directory. Delete the password file in the security directory and rename passwordWin
   to password, if you plan to use the supplied keystore without changing the supplied
   password (keeping this password is of course not recommended).

5. Select one of three ways to run the server:
   a. as a standalone console application using mail.bat
   b. as a wrapped console application using jes.bat
   c. as a wrapped service by executing Installjes-NT.bat and starting it by:
      I  . typing in the command console: net start Java_Email_Server,
      II . accessing the Services console, selecting Java Email Server and
           clicking on Start the Service,
      III. restarting the system.
Java Wrapper (if used) must be configured for proper JES operation.See AdditionalNotes.txt.
If you plan to run JES using mail.bat please read AdditionalNotes.txt.

* Unix Installation *
(This applies to a Debian/Ubuntu installation)

Extract the contents of the bin release archive to a directory, preferably in
/usr/local/jes or /opt/jes.
If JES is to be used with root privileges:
   Create a system user explicitly called jeserver with the following command using
   root privileges:
   sudo adduser --system --ingroup <userGroup> jeserver
   where <userGroup> should ideally be substituted by the group the administrator of JES
   belongs to. The wrapper start script has been altered to read the uid of the jeserver
   user from the system.
   Make sure everything in the install dir is owned by the jeserver user and admin group:
   sudo chown -R jeserver:<userGroup> /usr/local/jes
   Restrict the access to the installed files as desired.
   Make sure the jes.sh script in the bin dir is executable.
   Edit the jeserver script file in the bin install dir in order to set the JESPATH
   argument to the directory JES has been installed in.
   For example: JESPATH=/usr/local/jes or JESPATH=/opt/jes
   Move or copy the jerser script to /etc/init.d and make sure it is executable:
   sudo chmod ug+x /etc/init.d/jeserver
   Optionally prevent others from executing it:
   sudo chmod o-x /etc/init.d/jeserver
   In order to make JES start at boot time simply execute:
   sudo update-rc.d /etc/init.d/jeserver defaults 40 60
   The 40 60 figures are simply a recommendation.
If root privileges are not required:
   Make sure the mail.sh script in the bin dir is executable.
   Read section "Running JES using mail.bat in Windows / mail.sh in Unix likes" for changes
   needed before calling the script.
Edit the mail.conf, user.conf, log4j.properties(optionally), wrapper.conf files as needed.
See section entitled "Setting up JES for the first time" in AdditionalNotes.txt.
Have the needed passwords available in the "password" file in the security directory.
Call a script as root with a start argument or restart the system.
Java Wrapper (if used) must be configured for proper JES operation.See AdditionalNotes.txt.

That's it!
